\section{\textit{De-novo} assembly of sequenced reads}
\subsection{Installation of relevant tools}
For \denovo~assembly we will use \texttt{mira} assembler.
You can download it from \url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/mira-assembler/}.
Click on Files $\rightarrow$ MIRA $\rightarrow$ stable. Rightclick on \texttt{mira\_4.0.2\_linux-gnu\_x86\_64\_static.tar.bz2}
and \texttt{Copy link address}.
%Click download. New page will open and copy link address of \textit{direct link}
To download it on our linux server, we will be using command \texttt{wget}. In linux terminal type: \\~\\
\texttt{cd \textasciitilde/\progDir} \\
\texttt{wget -O mira.tar.bz2} \\

and paste the copied location.
%wget -O mira.tar.bz2 http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/mira-assembler/MIRA/stable/mira_4.0.2_linux-gnu_x86_64_static.tar.bz2?r=http%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Fmira-assembler%2F%3Fsource%3Dtyp_redirect&ts=1424879102&use_mirror=cznic
%We need to know the location of the program, and we
The program will be downloaded in our \texttt{\textasciitilde/\progDir} directory. 
The downloaded software is archived in .tar.bz2 format, therefore we need to extract it from archive.
To extract it from archive, type in terminal:\\~\\
\texttt{tar -jxvf mira.tar.bz2}\\

A new folder named \texttt{mira\_4.0.2\_linux-gnu\_x86\_64\_static} will appear.
This is our extracted software.
MIRA is already precompiled for us, so we just need
to find the compiled binary files in the folder and copy them in appropriate directory: \\~\\
\texttt{cd mira\_4.0.2\_linux-gnu\_x86\_64\_static} \\
\texttt{cd bin} \\
\texttt{cp mira \textasciitilde/\binDir} \\
\texttt{cd} \\
