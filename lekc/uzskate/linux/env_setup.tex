\section{Setup of the working environment}
Let's create directories for our data:\\~\\
\texttt{mkdir programs \\
mkdir NGS\_data \\
mkdir bin}\\~\\

%wget https://github.com/samtools/samtools/archive/develop.zip
Many of the open source tools are deposited in the \textit{github.com} repository.
To download software from github.com easily, we will use a tool called \git.

\Git~is already preinstalled on our servers, however, on your own Ubuntu servers
you can install it by typing:\\~\\
\texttt{sudo apt-get install git}\\

We will need a tool named samtools and we will download it with \git.
To install samtools, type:\\~\\
\texttt{cd programs}\\
\texttt{git clone https://github.com/samtools/samtools}\\
\texttt{git clone https://github.com/samtools/htslib}\\
\texttt{cd samtools}\\
\texttt{make}\\

To test whether samtools compiled correctly, type:\\~\\
\texttt{./samtools}\\

If you see the program's interface, then the program was compiled correctly.
Move obtained file to a directory where we will store our compiled software.\\~\\
\texttt{cp samtools \textasciitilde/bin\\
cd}\\

Installation of IonTorrent mapping software \textit{tmap}:\\~\\
%https://github.com/iontorrent/TS/tree/master/Analysis/TMAP
\texttt{cd programs}\\
\texttt{git clone git://github.com/iontorrent/TMAP.git}\\
\texttt{cd TMAP}\\
\texttt{git submodule init}\\
\texttt{git submodule update}\\
\texttt{sh autogen.sh}\\
\texttt{./configure}\\
\texttt{make}
%cp ~/data/samtools. .

%(unzip)
%unzip samtools.zip

%cd samtools-develop

%(make)
%(zlib1g-dev)
%(libncurses5-dev)
