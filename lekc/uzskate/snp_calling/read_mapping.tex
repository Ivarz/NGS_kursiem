\subsection{Read mapping against reference sequence}
To enable read mapper to efficiently read and process reference sequence, we need to
index reference sequence using mapping software's provided indexing function. Often generated
indexes are incompatible between different read mappers, as a consequence, almost every read
mapping software has their own indexing algorithms.

To perform reference sequence indexing with \texttt{tmap} software, type in linux terminal:\\~\\
\texttt{\refindex{\refSeq}}\\

To perform the actual read mapping against our reference, type:\\~\\
\tmap{\refSeq}{\mapReads.fastq}{\mapReads\_mapped.bam}\\
%TODO aprakstīt katru no soļiem
\sortbam{\mapReads\_mapped.bam}{\mapReads\_mapped.sorted.bam}\\
\reheader{\mapReads\_mapped.sorted.bam}{\mapReads\_mapped.sorted.reheaded.bam}
