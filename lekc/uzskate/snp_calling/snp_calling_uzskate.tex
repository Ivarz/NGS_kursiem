\section{Building variant calling pipeline}
We have \textit{IonTorrent} targeted resequencing data from human chromosomes 1., 2. and 19. 
Our task is to find all nonsynonymous and stop mutations present in the data
and to automatize this process by building data analysis pipeline.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Obtaining reference genome
  \item Read mapping against reference genome
  \item Variant calling
  \item Variant annotation
  \item Filtering of nonsynonymous and stop mutation variants
  \item Pipeline building
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Obtaining reference genome}
