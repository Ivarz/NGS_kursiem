\section{Building variant calling pipeline}
We have \IonTorrent~targeted resequencing data from human chromosomes 1., 2. and 19. 
Our task is to find all nonsynonymous and stop mutations present in the data
and to automatize this process by building data analysis pipeline.
To accomplish this task we can divide our work in following subtasks:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Installation of relevant tools
  \item Obtaining of reference sequences
  \item Read mapping against reference genome
  \item Variant calling
  \item Variant annotation
  \item Filtering of nonsynonymous and stop mutation variants
  \item Pipeline building
\end{itemize}

%\subsection{Obtaining reference sequences}
%We begin our task by obtaining reference genome. We will download reference
%sequences in a seperate directory to avoid file cluttering. Let's make
%a new directory in our \texttt{\workDir}~named \texttt{\reseqDir}, and there we will create
%a seperate folder \texttt{\refDir} for our reference sequences:\\~\\
%\texttt{cd \textasciitilde}\\
%\texttt{cd \workDir}\\
%\texttt{mkdir \reseqDir}\\
%\texttt{cd \reseqDir}\\
%\texttt{mkdir \refDir}\\
%\texttt{cd \refDir}\\

%Our reference sequences can be accessed from a database made by
%University of California, Santa Cruz.
%The web address of the database is \url{http://genome.ucsc.edu/}.
