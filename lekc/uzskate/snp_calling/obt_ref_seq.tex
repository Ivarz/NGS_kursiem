\subsection{Obtaining reference sequences}
We begin our task by obtaining reference genome. We will download reference
sequences in a seperate directory to avoid file cluttering. Let's make
a new directory in our \texttt{\workDir}~named \texttt{\reseqDir}, and there we will create
a seperate folder \texttt{\refDir} for our reference sequences:\\~\\
\texttt{cd \textasciitilde}\\
\texttt{cd \workDir}\\
\texttt{mkdir \reseqDir}\\
\texttt{cd \reseqDir}\\
\texttt{mkdir \refDir}\\
\texttt{cd \refDir}\\

Our reference sequences can be accessed from a database made by
University of California, Santa Cruz.
The web address of the database is \url{http://genome.ucsc.edu/}.
To find the necessary references sequences for chromosomes 1., 2. and 19.
click on \texttt{Downloads} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{human} $\rightarrow$
\texttt{Data set by chromosome}. Right click on \texttt{chr1.fa.gz}
and choose \texttt{Copy link location}. In terminal type\\~\\
\texttt{wget} \\

and paste the copied location. The reference sequence is compressed in .gz
format, so we need to extract it:\\~\\
\texttt{gzip -d chr1.fa.gz}\\

File chr1.fa will appear in our folder.

Repeat the process for chromosomes 2. and 19.
